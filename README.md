# Security-Audit-for-Botium-toys
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I worked as a cybersecurity analyst and conducted a security audit for a fictional company named Botium Toys,
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 

the task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist.

the first thing came to my mind after reading this is identify the major risks that our esteemed organization faces. By pinpointing these risks, we can strategize and implement effective measures to mitigate them.<br>
after that prioritize the implementation of controls. Which controls should take precedence and be put into action immediately, while also considering those that can be addressed in the future This way, we can ensure a systematic and efficient approach to enhancing our security posture.
I listed those controls and their priority in a table.

Next, let's address compliance regulations that demand our attention. It's crucial for Botium Toys to adhere to these regulations in order to safeguard customer and vendor data, avoid penalties, and maintain a reputation of trustworthiness. Together, we will ensure the utmost safety and security of our valuable assets.
